/**
 * Capstone brief — API Developer track (api-dev), v1.
 *
 * DRAFT by Claude, 2026-10-03 — status stays "draft" until a human has read
 * every requirement, rubric line and twist. The seeder refuses to publish a
 * brief whose `reviewed` flag is false.
 *
 * Shape notes:
 * - requirements[].check is for the stage-2 automated checks. `file` is a glob
 *   matched against the repo tree at the pinned commit. Requirements without a
 *   check are judged only by the AI rubric review.
 * - rubric[].weight values sum to 100. rubric[].layerId maps a weak criterion
 *   back to the roadmap layer that teaches it, for weak-spot tracking.
 * - Bump `version` for any change that affects grading; never edit a
 *   published version in place (attempts point at the exact brief document).
